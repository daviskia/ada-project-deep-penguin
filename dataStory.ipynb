    "### Why Bikeshare?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bikeshare systems are an alternative form of public transport to traditional buses and subways which allow users to pick up and drop of shared bikes at specific stations around the city. The use of the bikeshare system has been increasing, making it an important feature to consider in the city's complete transport system. Biking is both more environmentally friendly and more healthy than automobiles, and incorporating this system is a benefit to the city's inhabitants. we thus want to analyse the system to see how people currenlty use the system and then find improvements to maximize and encourage the use of this beneficial form of transport. We especially want to analyse it with respect to it's interactions and incorportation with other tranport infrastructures. "
